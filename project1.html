    <h2> What it does is nothing special </h2>
    <h3> ==> Draws a lattice on the screen using for loops and GL_POINTS </h3>
    <h3> ==> Now, let's add a twist, instead of drawing the points normally, lets give them variable color, in my case, i gave it a horizontal gradient </h3>
    <h3> ==> Draws a line from left to right and one from top to bottom using GL_LINES </h3>
    <h3> ==> Custom one liner function to draw vectors from any point to any point</h3>
